# âš¡ State-wise Energy Consumption Forecasting in India

This project focuses on forecasting daily energy consumption across Indian states using three advanced models: **SARIMA**, **LSTM**, and **XGBoost**. The aim is to evaluate which model performs best for time series forecasting based on performance metrics such as **RMSE**, **MAE**, **MAPE**, and **RÂ² Score**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Daily state-wise power consumption data for Indian states (2019â€“2020).
- **Problem Statement**: Forecast energy consumption for each state and compare models based on their accuracy.
- **Models Implemented**:
  - **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA) â€“ Statistical time series model
  - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) â€“ Recurrent Neural Network for sequential prediction
  - **XGBoost** â€“ Gradient boosting regression with lag features

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels (for SARIMA)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## ðŸ§  Model Descriptions

### 1. SARIMA
A seasonal ARIMA model trained separately for each state using parameters:
- Order: `(1, 1, 1)`
- Seasonal Order: `(1, 1, 1, 7)`
- Used Statsmodels SARIMAX for implementation.

### 2. LSTM
- Sequence-based neural network model.
- Used past 30 days to predict the next dayâ€™s consumption.
- Model architecture: 1 LSTM layer â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense layer.
- Input reshaped to `[samples, timesteps, features]`.

### 3. XGBoost
- Tree-based boosting model with lag features.
- Used `lag_1` to `lag_30` as predictors.
- Trained per state using `XGBRegressor`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **RÂ² Score**: Coefficient of Determination
